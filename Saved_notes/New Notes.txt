- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**
  - Used for sequential data with dependencies between elements
  - Examples: Natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition
  - Types of RNNs include:
    - Long short-term memory (LSTM)
    - Gated recurrent unit (GRU)

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
  - Used for data with grid-like structure, such as images and audio
  - Feature extraction is done through convolutions, allowing for spatial relationships to be learned
  - Examples: Image classification, object detection
  - Layers in CNNs include:
    - Convolutional layers
    - Pooling layers
    - Fully connected layers

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
  - Non-parametric algorithm for classification and regression
  - Assigns a label or value to a new data point based on the majority vote or average of its k nearest neighbors in the training set
  - Examples: Handwritten digit recognition, medical diagnosis
  - Hyperparameters:
    - Number of neighbors (k)
    - Distance metric used for calculating nearest neighbors
