**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

**Overview:**
* KNN is a non-parametric, supervised machine learning algorithm that classifies data by considering the labels of its K nearest neighbors.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Distance metric:** Measure of similarity between data points (e.g., Euclidean distance, cosine similarity).
* **K:** Number of nearest neighbors used for classification.
* **Majority vote:** Assigns the class label that occurs most frequently among the K nearest neighbors.

**Examples:**

* Classifying handwritten digits (MNIST dataset)
* Predicting customer churn
* Identifying fraudulent transactions

**Steps:**

1. Choose a distance metric and a value for K.
2. Calculate the distance between the new data point and all other data points.
3. Find the K nearest neighbors.
4. Assign the class label based on a majority vote.

**Advantages:**

* Simple and easy to implement
* Non-parametric, making it suitable for diverse data types
* Performs well with small datasets

**Disadvantages:**

* Sensitive to noise and outliers
* Computational cost can be high for large datasets
* Can be biased towards dominant classes

**Hyperparameter Tuning:**

* **K:** Experiment with different values to find the optimal K for the specific dataset.
* **Distance metric:** Consider alternative metrics to improve classification accuracy.
